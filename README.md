# Practices: Hands-On Machine Learning Journey

This repository documents my journey through the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron. The goal of this repository is to provide an in-depth walkthrough of my learning process, making it easy for others to follow along and understand my progress.

All code in this repository is taken from the [official repository](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2) by the author of the book. This repository's purpose is not to claim ownership of the code but to showcase my journey, understanding, and progress in working through the book.

## Repository Structure

This repository is structured as follows:

- Each chapter has its own folder (e.g., `Chapter01`, `Chapter02`, etc.).
- Within each chapter's folder, you will find the following:
    - Code files sourced from the [official repository](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2) implementing the techniques and models discussed in that chapter.
    - A `README.md` file summarizing the main points and personal insights gained from the chapter.
    - Any additional resources or relevant materials used in learning and implementing the contents of the chapter.

## Prerequisites

Before you start exploring this repository, make sure you have a basic understanding of Python programming and the principles of Machine Learning. Familiarity with libraries such as Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow would be beneficial but not necessary as the code and notes in the repository will guide you through these.
